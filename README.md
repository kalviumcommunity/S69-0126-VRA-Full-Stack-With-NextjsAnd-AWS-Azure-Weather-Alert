# Flood Early Warning & Visualization System

A web-based early-warning system designed to help residents in **flood-prone districts** prepare in advance by visualizing **real-time meteorological data** and issuing **clear, actionable alerts**.

This project is being built as part of a **4-week Full-Stack Development Sprint** using **Next.js and cloud services (AWS/Azure)**.

---

## Problem Statement

Flood-prone regions often have access to open meteorological data such as rainfall, weather forecasts, and river levels.  
However, this data is:

- Scattered across multiple sources  
- Difficult for non-technical users to understand  
- Not presented in a timely or actionable manner  

As a result, local residents are unable to **prepare early**, leading to property damage, delayed evacuation, and safety risks.

---

## Proposed Solution

We aim to build a **centralized web platform** that:

- Fetches **open meteorological data** from reliable public APIs  
- Transforms raw weather data into **simple visual indicators**  
- Displays **flood risk levels** (Low / Medium / High)  
- Provides **early alerts and warnings** to users  

The platform focuses on **clarity, performance, and accessibility**, ensuring that even non-technical users can understand flood risks at a glance.

---

## Target Users

- Residents of flood-prone districts  
- Local community volunteers  
- Disaster preparedness teams (basic usage)

---

## Key Features (Planned)

- Location-based weather and rainfall monitoring  
- Flood risk status indicators  
- Real-time or near-real-time data visualization  
- Simple alert system for high-risk conditions  
- Responsive and lightweight user interface  

---

## Proposed Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js (App Router)**
- React Server Components
- HTML / CSS (Tailwind optional)

### Backend
- Node.js APIs (built into Next.js)
- Server-side data fetching

### Data Sources
- Open meteorological APIs (e.g., Open-Meteo, government open data)

### Cloud & Deployment
- AWS or Azure (TBD)
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions

---

## Project Scope
