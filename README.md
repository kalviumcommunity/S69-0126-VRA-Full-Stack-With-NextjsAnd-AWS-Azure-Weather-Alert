# 🌊 Flood Early Warning & Visualization System

A web-based early-warning system designed to help residents in **flood-prone districts** prepare in advance by visualizing **real-time meteorological data** and issuing **clear, actionable alerts**.

This project is being built as part of a **4-week Full-Stack Development Sprint** using **Next.js and cloud services (AWS/Azure)**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Flood-prone regions often have access to open meteorological data such as rainfall, weather forecasts, and river levels.  
However, this data is:

- Scattered across multiple sources  
- Difficult for non-technical users to understand  
- Not presented in a timely or actionable manner  

As a result, local residents are unable to **prepare early**, leading to property damage, delayed evacuation, and safety risks.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

We aim to build a **centralized web platform** that:

- Fetches **open meteorological data** from reliable public APIs  
- Transforms raw weather data into **simple visual indicators**  
- Displays **flood risk levels** (Low / Medium / High)  
- Provides **early alerts and warnings** to users  

The platform focuses on **clarity, performance, and accessibility**, ensuring that even non-technical users can understand flood risks at a glance.
